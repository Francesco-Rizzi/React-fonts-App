# React fonts App 🖊

###### This is just an \[🔬 experiment\].

#### Description:
A React with Redux experiment on creating a fonts app.

It shows a list of important fonts in a slider (built from scratch with React and Redux, no libraries used). Clicking on an item you move (slide) between them. Clicking on the selected one you open the detail page in a smooth transition. All transitions are CSS based.

Redux manages the state and takes care of keeping all the different UI components updated.

#### Tech stuff 👾:
