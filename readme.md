# React slider fonts App

#### \[this is just an exercise\]

#### Description:
An imaginary fonts app, which shows the most important fonts (fake data to date) in a slider (built from scratch, no libraries). Clicking on one you move (slide) between them. Clicking on the selected one you open the detail page in with a smooth transition. Redux manages the state and takes care of keeping all the different UI components updated. All transitions are CSS based.
